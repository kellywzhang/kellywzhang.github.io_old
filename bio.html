Kelly W. Zhang is a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Harvard University advised by Susan A. Murphy and Lucas Janson. Her research focuses on addressing challenges faced when applying reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world problems, particularly mobile health. She has developed methods for statistical inference for data collected by bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms, i.e., adaptively collected data. She also works on developing the reinforcement learning algorithm to be used in Oralytics, a mobile health app aimed to help users develop healthy oral hygiene habits, in collaboration with Oral-B and researchers at UCLA and UMichigan. She has co-organized workshops at NeurIPS on mobile health and causal inference, and organized an invited session at the 2022 Institute of Mathematical Sciences annual meeting on adaptively collected data. She has worked as a research intern at Apple HealthAI, Facebook AI Research, and eBay. She is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
