I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia Business School</a> in the Descision, Risk, and Optimization group, working with <a href="https://djrusso.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Russo</a> and <a href="https://hsnamkoong.github.io/">Hongseok Namkoong</a>.
My research interests lie at the intersection of <em>adaptive experimentation</em>, <em>reinforcement learning</em>, and <em>statistical inference</em>.
In fall 2024, I will start as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial College London</a> in the Mathematics Department (statistics section). I will also be a faculty member in the <a href="https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imperial-X</a>, an interdisciplinary AI initiative.

I completed my Ph.D. student in computer science at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard University</a> in the <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab</a>.
I was advised by <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Murphy</a> and <a href="http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Janson</a>. I was supported by an NSF Graduate Fellowship during my PhD and was selected to be a <a href="https://www.siebelscholars.com/articles/welcome-class-of-2023-siebel-scholars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siebel Scholar</a> in 2023.

Even earlier, I worked on natural language processing and deep learning with <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/rush.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sasha Rush</a>, <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Bowman</a>, and <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yann LeCun</a>. I also previously interned at <a href="https://www.apple.com/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's HealthAI</a> team in Seattle, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook AI Research</a> in New York, and at <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a> New York on the homepage recommendations team.
