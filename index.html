        <h2 class="smallcap">about</h2>
        <p>I'm a second year PhD student in computer science at Harvard in the <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html">Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab</a>.
        I'm interested in understanding and addressing the challenges people face when applying reinforcement learning algorithms to real world problems.
        I am currently working on statistical inference methods for adaptively collected data, e.g. data collected using a bandit.
        I am advised by <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/">Susan Murphy</a> and <a href="http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/">Lucas Janson</a>.

        <p>I presented a couple papers at the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/">ML²</a> reading group.</p>
        
        <p><b>Generalization with Adaptive Gradient Methods</b>
        <br />On <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08292">The Marginal Value of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Machine Learning</a>, which demonstrates that in an easy-to-analyze linear setting, adaptive gradient methods can find solutions that generalize worse than those found by SGD (April 3, 2018).
        <br />[<a href="https://github.com/kellywzhang/marginal-value-of-adaptive-gradients/blob/master/adaptive-gradient.pdf">presentation</a>]
        </p>
        
        
        <p><b>Text Disentanglement</b>
        <br />On two text disentanglement papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00955">Toward Controlled Generation of Text</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09655">Style Transfer with Non-Parallel Corpora</a> (July 25, 2017).
        <br />[<a href="https://github.com/kellywzhang/ReadingGroup/blob/master/disentangletext/disentangletext.pdf">presentation</a>]
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Long Short Term Memory</b>
        <br />On the <a href="http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf">original LSTM paper</a>, the importance of gates, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00387">highway networks</a> (April 18, 2017).
