        <p>I spent the first 18 years of my life residing in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>I studied economics for two years at the University of Chicago, and spent two summers in Beijing studying and doing research work in environmental policy. I had my first exposure to programming in my macroeconomics class modelling with Bellman equations (which I loved).</p>
        <p>I took a year-long leave of absence from UChicago that I spent studying computer science and machine learning back in Massachusetts. During that time, I worked on a couple start-up projects: <a href="https://www.world-ly.com/">Worldly</a> and <a href="http://hyperloop.global/">Hyperloop Transportation Technologies</a>.</p>
        <p>Fall 2016, I transferred to NYU, where I have happily been ever since.</p>
