    <h2 class="smallcap">what i'm listening to</h2>

    <p>
    After moving to New York, I started listening to rap and hip-hop music.
    Previously, it was a type of music that I thought I'd never enjoy. 
    Friends have asked me to introduce them to rap and I'm share a few of my favorite tracks here.
    Email me (nyu account) for my full playlist of recommendations. 
    The few songs here are all by Kendrick as his lyricism is what drew me into this genre.

    <b>i by Kendrick Lamar</b>
    Everybody looking at you crazy / What you gonna do? / Lift up your head and keep moving / Or let the paranoia haunt you / Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart / On my sleeve, let the runway start / You know the miserable do love company / What do you want from me and my scars? / Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence / How many times my potential was anonymous? / How many times the city making me promises? / So I promise this / I love myself
    </p>

    <b>untitled 06 | 06.30.2014 by Kendrick Lamar</b>
    I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero / Cause you believe in me / No you're not easily impressed / But I possess qualities that you need to see / Look at my flaws, look at my flaws / Look at my imperfections and all / Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause / And yours equally valued / You stick out like an alien compared to those around you / And that's alright because I like it / You and me are the same / Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change / Because I know for sure who you are
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst by Kendrick Lamar</b>
    I count lives, all on these songs / Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong / Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong / And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone / Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? / Promise that you will sing about me
    <!-- 
    I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you / In case I'm not here tomorrow / I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind / I'm behind on what's really important / My mind is really distorted / I find nothing but trouble in my life / I'm fortunate you believe in a dream / This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine / And last night was just another distraction / Or a reaction of what we consider madness / I know exactly what happened / You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help / Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel / Like everything was alright / And a fight he tried to put up, but the type / Of bullet that stuck had went against his will / As blood spilled on your hands

    <b>FEAR by Kendrick Lamar</b>
    At 27 years old, my biggest fear was being judged / How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city / What they say about me reveal / If my reputation would miss me / What they see from me / Would trickle down generations in time / What they hear from me / Would make them highlight my simplest lines / I'm talking fear, fear of losing creativity / I'm talking fear, fear of missing out on you and me / I'm talking fear, fear of losing loyalty from pride
