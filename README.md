# kellywzhang.github.io

I want this site to describe the projects that I'm working on, as well as provide clear descriptions of the concepts and papers I read about machine learning, neural networks, and natural languge understanding.

I find other people's blogs on these topics very helpful, and thought I would make my own for papers and concepts that I haven't seen covered elsewhere. I will add to this site after this semester during my winter break.
