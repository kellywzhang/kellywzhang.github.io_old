I organized an <a href="https://www.imsannualmeeting-london2022.com/invited-sessions">invited session at the 2022 Institute of Mathematical Statistics Annual Meeting</a> on <i>"Inference Methods for Adaptively Collected Data"</i>. The speakers will be Nathan Kallus, Koulik Khamaru, Evan Munro, and myself! Joseph Jay Williams and Nina Deliu will chair the session.
